Here‚Äôs a **clean, ready-to-go** `README.md` for your **Commitizen-like CLI** tool in a Git repository, using the `git-cm-lite.sh` script.

## üìö README: Commitizen Lite for Git via Bash

### üöÄ Overview

This is a lightweight, **Commitizen-like CLI tool** designed to help automate standardized commit messages in any Git repository. It's entirely written in **Bash**, requiring no Node.js or external dependencies. Use this tool for a simple, consistent commit process, even if you're using a non-Node.js tech stack.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Type** your commit (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`).
- Optionally add a **scope** (e.g., `auth`, `api`).
- Provide a **short description** for the commit.
- Add an optional **long description** (multi-line).
- Specify if your commit includes **breaking changes**.
- Link issues that are **closed** by the commit (e.g., `#123`).
- Fully POSIX-compliant, **works on Linux/macOS** with no external dependencies.

---

### üß∞ Setup

#### 1. Clone the repository (or navigate to your existing project):
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <your-repo>
```

#### 2. Set up the Git alias to use the `git-cm-lite.sh` script:
Run the setup script to automatically configure the alias in your Git repo.

```bash
sh .git-cm-setup.sh
```

This will add the following Git alias to your repository:
```bash
git config alias.cm '!sh ./git-cm-lite.sh'
```

---

### üöÄ Usage

#### 1. **Stage your changes**:
```bash
git add .
```

#### 2. **Run `git cm`** to trigger the interactive commit process:
```bash
git cm
```

You'll be prompted to:
- Choose a commit **type** (e.g., `feat`, `fix`).
- Optionally provide a **scope** (e.g., `auth`, `login`).
- Enter a **short description** (required).
- Optionally provide a **long description** (multi-line).
- Specify if there are **breaking changes**.
- Optionally link **issue numbers** (e.g., `#123, #456`).

The resulting commit message will follow the **conventional commit format**:
```bash
<type>(<scope>): <short description>
<long description>
BREAKING CHANGE: <description>
Closes <issue #>
```

Example output:
```bash
feat(auth): add token validation

Added JWT parsing and validation for user authentication.

BREAKING CHANGE: The token format has changed.

Closes #123
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Scripts

#### **`git-cm-lite.sh`**
The main Bash script that runs the commit flow. It will:
- Prompt the user for necessary commit details.
- Format the commit message according to the **Conventional Commits** standard.
- Run `git commit` with multiple `-m` options for proper formatting.

#### **`.git-cm-setup.sh`**
This script configures the Git alias to easily run `git cm` in your repository:
```bash
git config alias.cm '!sh ./git-cm-lite.sh'
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- This solution is **cross-platform** and should work on Linux/macOS.
- **No Node.js** or additional tools are required to run this script.
- Ensure that you are using **Git Bash** or **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** for full compatibility on Windows.
- For PowerShell on Windows, you can use the `bash` command to run the script (e.g., `bash ./git-cm-lite.sh`).
